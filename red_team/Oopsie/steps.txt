Nothing interesting abut this machine up until the access of the upload page where you can upload
a php script for reverse shell . From that point on you search for any php files for credentials
(find www -type f -name "*.php"). In db.php you find the credentials for rober user . When you search with sudo -l 
you find that there are no commands that have root privileges . Instead using the 'id' you see that the robert user is part
of a (bugtracker) group with the id 1001 .A file with SUID always executes as the user who owns the
file, regardless of the user passing the command. If the file owner doesn't have
execute permissions, then use an uppercase S here.
In our case, the binary 'bugtracker' is owned by root & we can execute it as root since
it has SUID set. My initial approach was to simply enter ../robot.txt to display the password in the bugtracker executable , it worked (TODO: talk about alternative approach)
